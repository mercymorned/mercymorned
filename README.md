- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mercymorned (or Ronan)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, as a recent career switcher.

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: mercymorned @ bluesky, ronan@griffincrescent.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them/theirs
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an American who immigrated to New Zealand. It comes in handy for never accidentally writing "colour" in my CSS.
